machine learning

means
 - finding patterns
 - recognising them when they appear again
 - use patterns to predict the future


(contains patterns)     (finds patterns)               (recognises patterns)
data                 -> Machine Learning Algorithm  -> Model                 
                                                         /\
                                                Application - provides data to model

Process
 - choose the right question to ask
 - do you have the right data?
 - how will you measure success?

two types:
 - supervised and unsupervised

supervised means the training data contains the value you want to predict
unsupervised means the value you want to predict is not in the training data.

get data from data sources and preprocess to clean and shape data, to prepare it for training the model
training data has features (columns) and target value (column representing the value we want to predict)

categorising problems
most common
 - regression
   - have data, want to find a line through the data points in order to estimate - supervised

 - classification
   - have data, want to know what class a new data point will be in, e.g. is this credit card txn fraudulent? (yes/no) - supervised. Normally get back %age of probability.

 - clustering
   - have data, want to find clusters in data - used in unsupervised learning. e.g. what are our customer segments?

styles
 - decision tree
 - neural network
 - bayesian
 - k-means
 - loads more - very complicated!
